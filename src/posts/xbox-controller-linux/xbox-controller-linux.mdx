# Xbox one Bluetooth on Linux
Configure an Xbox360 or Xbox One controller to work on your Linux system using [https:https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xpadneo-dkms](XpadneoDKMS) open-source driver!! Often times when trying to pair an Xbox controller, the computer will attempt pairing but the Xbox light on the controller won't remain lit after pairing. Read on my dear friend!

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a free and open source framework for developing blazing fast websites and apps.

## Prereqs

*** Installing
**** Prereqs:
```shell
# ARCH
sudo pacman -S dkms linux-headers bluez bluez-utils
# DEBIAN
sudo apt-get install dkms linux-headers-`uname -r`
# FEDORA
sudo dnf install dkms make bluez bluez-tools kernel-devel-`uname -r` kernel-headers-`uname -r`
# RASPBIAN
sudo apt-get install dkms raspberrypi-kernel-headers
```

## Installing XpadNeo
Installation

- Download the Repository to your local machine git clone https://github.com/atar-axis/xpadneo.git
- cd xpadneo
- If using DKMS, run sudo ./install.sh
- If not using DKMS, follow steps above (generic distribution)
    Done!

**** Connecting the controller via the terminal:
```shell
    sudo bluetoothctl
    [bluetooth]# scan on
    wait until all available devices are listed (otherwise it may be hard to identify which one is the gamepad)
    push the connect button on upper side of the gamepad, and hold it down until the light starts flashing fast
    wait for the gamepad to show up in bluetoothctl, remember the address (e.g. `C8:3F:26:XX:XX:XX`)
    [bluetooth]# scan off to stop scanning as it may interfere with properly pairing the controller
    [bluetooth]# pair \<MAC>
    [bluetooth]# trust \<MAC>
    [bluetooth]# connect \<MAC> (should usually not be needed but there are open bugs)
    The \<MAC> parameter is optional if the command line already shows the controller name
```

## Config Files
Edit the file `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf` with:

```shell
[LE]
MinConnectionInterval=7
MaxConnectionInterval=9
ConnectionLatency=0

[General]
ControllerMode = dual
JustWorksRepairing = confirm
```
